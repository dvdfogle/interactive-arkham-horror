In a time and age undreamt of in the modern world, she forced spirits to obey her and destroyed her enemies with terrifying energies.
She might have never known of her previous incarnation had she not fallen from a ladder and hit her head while changing a light in the diner. But when she awoke in the hospital, she whispered one word, "Hyperborea."
Even then, she would have dismissed her visions of a past life as simple hallucinations if it wasn''t for the fact that the spells she dreamed of were real. Trying one in secret, mortally embarrassed to even be attempting it, she was stunned to see it take effect. Since then, she has been nurturing her new powers in secret, extremely careful not to let anyone else find out.
But as Agnes finishes her shift at the diner this evening, a whisper in the air warns her. Something is coming. Something that destroyed her once before, in the ancient past, and she must be prepared.');

Studying at the feet of the old shaman, she learned how to speak to the spirits, how to read the bones of the earth, and how to avoid the fell creatures that dwelt in the dark places.
Her education was supplemented by tutoring from an earnest young missionary. Her mentor allowed the man to teach her as long as he taught her English and other modern topics in addition to trying to convert her to Christianity.
As for his religion, Akachi was uninterested, for she had already learned many of the great secrets of lore, and felt the power of the old ways.
Recently, her old mentor called her to his bedside. His face was pale and gaunt. "Akachi, I have seen that a great trial is coming for you. You must go to the United States, to a city called Arkham. There, you will have to face one of the old creatures, using the things that I have taught you."
Weeks later, as she opens the door to Ye Olde Magick Shoppe, Akachi hopes that she can meet the challenge that lies ahead of her.');

On her way to talk to one of her professors last month, she saw a painting in the hallway that captured her attention with its hazy depiction of some horrible creature rising up out of the ocean. Ever since, Amanda has heard strange whispers in a foreign language whenever her attention drifts. More disturbingly, she has begun to dream of the vast green depths of the ocean and terrible alien cities that lie in its darkest crevasses.
This evening, as she finishes her shift as a bank teller at the First Bank of Arkham, something out of the night calls to her-- something dark and sinister that leaves the feel of sea foam in her mind and makes her gasp with the effort of resisting it. Leaning against the brick wall of the bank, Amanda realizes that she has to find out what''s happening to her or she''s going to fall prey to whatever alien presence is invading her mind.');

While he was in the General Store selling his wares, a robed man came in and bought several items, paying with old gold coins. Astounded, Bob turned to the shopkeeper for an explanation, but the man just ignored his questions, simply saying, "That happens, sometimes."
Now, Bob isn''t leaving until he figues out where those gold coins came from. If he plays his cards right, maybe this will be the big score. Maybe he''ll finally be able to retire and buy that boat he''s had his eye on and spend the rest of his days fishing in a tropical paradise. Then again, moybe Bob will finally come to see that all that glitters is not gold.');

Of course, he couldn''t tell anyone-- couldn''t reveal what he had pieced together, reports from various parts of the city government that painted a macabre portrait of Arkham''s future. For one, who''d believe him? For another, how would widespread panic serve the public good?
Still, Charlie has always had connections in town. So he gathered up his reports and paid a visit to Professor Grant at Miskatonic University.
The fact that he now stands before Professor Grant''s mutilated corpse in Professor Grant''s blood-stained office, does not fill Chalie Kane with confidence.');

She started reading tales of horror at a young age, thrilling to the terror of Edgar Allen Poe, of Stoker''s Dracula. She explored in fiction what she abhorred in life-- horror, violence, fear.
Then, she stumbled across the John Dee edition of the Necronomicon. It was macabre indeed. It was also blasphemous, unholy, and too awful to be real. Frankenstein  and "The Raven" were forgotten. The chills that ran down Daisy''s spine were not those of a forbidden pleasure. A new horror was born in her mind, a terror that such things could be.
There were more books after that-- De Vermiis Mysteriis, Cultes des Goules-- each worse than the last. She read them all in a mounting panic. Could they be real? Could the things they spoke of be true?
Now she knows it to be so. The Thing that appeared in library was something she''d read about in the Ponape Scripture. If the Thing was real, then everything she''d read about might be real... in which case Daisy is the only one who knows how to stop it.');

As they say, be careful what you wish for. Years later, in a rundown store, Dexter came across a burnt and torn fragment of the Necronomicon itself. Intrigued by this ancient piece of occult knowledge, Dexter began to use his wealth in search of the truth about the ancient lore, and what he found horrified him.
Now, the more he learns, the less he wants to know, but his studies have led him to believe that a great evil will soon arise in Arkham. He knows that he may well be the only person with the ability to stop this evil from swallowing the world, so he has come to that sleepy town to speak with the proprietor of Ye Olde Magick Shoppe, one of the few magic shops that contain true lore, and not merely the stage tricks he once studied.');

As the owner of a small women''s clothing shop, she wanted to fit into the community as quickly as possible. Therefore, she joined the Chamber of Commerce, the Women''s league, and the Historical Society. Her efforts were clearly paying off since business was booming, and just a few months ago Carl Sanford invited her to join a very elite club in Arkham-- the Silver Twilight Lodge.
Her initial joy at the invitation has since turned to horror. The weekly meetings have been growing ever more disturbing since she advanced to the second rank of the Order, and her sleep has become haunted by nightmarish beings. Last week she actually witnessed the summoning of a dark creature and learned that an evil plot to summon what Sanford refers to as an Ancient One was in motion. It was at that moment that Diana decided to not only get away from the Order, but also to stop them. She is aware that when the Order finds out what she''s doing they''ll come for her, but she sees this as her only chance for redemption, whatever the cost.');

Until they banned alcohol, he was just drifting through life, doing odd jobs here and there. But afterwards, the demand for alcohol rose to such a fever pitch that he was able to make a comfortable living evading the law and giving people what they wanted. His new lifestyle particularly suited his personality, providing him with a taste of danger, plenty of cash, and a great deal of personal satisfaction.
Of course, those things are all well and good until you find yourself running through the woods at night trying to lose a bunch of knife-wielding maniacs who want to  sacrifice you to their dark gods.
Although Finn has never been a vengeful man, that incident left him rattled in ways he hadn''t been since getting beaten up on the playground years ago.
Stepping out of the bank with enough borrowed cash for guns and supplies, Finn vows that those lunatics will regret the day they ever crossed him.');

Possessing a keen mind and a charismatic personality, he found that he excelled in his chosen field and soon rose to a position of power and wealth. George enjoyed the challenge of practicing law, and the years rolled past in a pleasant blur until he was ready to retire. He figured that he and his wife, Maria, would buy a boat and sail around the world.
That was before the night when his home was invaded, his wife was murdered, and his house was burned to the ground by two men wearing strange amulets.
Now, he has tracked these men to the city of Arkham. They will pay for making him feel helpless, and for taking away his dear, sweet Maria. after all, if there''s one thing lawyers are known for, it''s collecting debts that are owed to them.');

After years of visiting doctors and some therapy, she learned to control her visions somewhat by writing stories. Her weird and disturbing fiction somehow spoke to the public in these troubled times, and has made her a bestselling writer.
This evening, while leaving a book signing she''s attending in Arkham, she was knocked to the ground by the most powerful vision she''s ever experienced. Gloria saw the sky tear open, and a huge and montrous form pour out of the very air itself, wreaking untold havoc and killing thousands. As she sat on the ground with her arms wrapped around herself, Gloria knew, somehow, that this vision was real, and that it would come to pass unless she did something about it.
Now, she finds herself in a run-down diner, sipping coffee and trying to decide what to do.');

He wasn''t stupid, exactly, he just didn''t spend a lot of time thinking things through before he did them. A lot of the time, this tended to get him in trouble.
Then again, sometimes it came in handy, like it had in the last month when he heard the cows panicking. Picking up his shotgun, Hank rushed outside, only to see some kind of giant buzzard thing attacking the cattle. Now, some might have questioned their own sanity at the sight while others might have fainted away in sheer horror. But Hank, he just took aim and blew the darn thing''s head off. It only occurred to him later to wonder just what it had been.
When Pa saw the corpse, he told Hank that they were going to take it to a Professor he knew at Miskatonic University. So, they crated it up, drove to the nearest train station, and hopped a train to Arkham.
Only, things haven''t gone so well since then. First, the crate vanished off the train, and then Pa went missing when he went to complain about the missing crate.
As Hank grows tired of waiting at the General Store where his Pa told him to meet up if they got separated, he wonders if he might not have to start doing a little thinking after all.');

A quiet town that is to be destroyed by a terrible creature before the world is plunged into indescribable chaos for a thousand years. Her dreams have never been wrong before.
Unable to ignore this latest vision, Jaqueline did some research and found the location of the doomed city. Now she has come to the place that haunts her to try and stop the destruction she knows will come. Drawn to an image from her darkest dreams, she takes a deep breath as she enters the Curiositie Shoppe-- a place she knows will soon become a nightmare made flesh.');

The outside of the envelope was partailly stained with blood, and it was mailed from Arkham. That was the last letter from Isabelle she received.
Jenny has since returned to the States, coming to Arkham to find her missing sister. Stepping off the train from Boston into the dark autumn night, she believes that her sister was abducted by a strange cult, and is determined to find her and thwart the plans of those that took her... even if she has to save all of Arkham in the process.');

Daddy used to say a lot of stupid things.
Jazz has been nothing but trouble for Jim since the day he picked up his daddy''s trumpet. There was something weird and otherworldly about the writing on the inside of the bell, but the tones from it were smooth and dark, like good coffee. There was something about it that made you want to tap your feet and snap your fingers. That trumpet landed Jim a lot of gigs until the time it made Widow Jenkins get up and dance, the day he played at her funeral. After that, it was kind of hard to find work, especially playing funerals.
Since then, Jim has learned a lot about jazz-- and the things the graveyard ghouls talk about on cold autumn nights. Lately, they''ve been talking about The End, as in the end of everything that is and could be. The Final Rhapsody. The fact is, Jim isn''t too keen on that idea. He''s got more songs he wants to play before then. So, sitting in a booth at Velma''s, Jim takes one last swallow of hot coffee before heading out to play what could be his last encore. The coffee is smooth and dark going down, just like the night...');

Leo couldn''t read the tablets they found in those ruins-- only Dr. Volk could, of the seven of them-- but he''s holding the good doctor''s notes in his hand. The ones Volk took before he went mad. Before he killed two of Anderson''s men.
Now Anderson''s fresh off the boat and he''s got word that Dr. Philips, the man who organized the Yucatan expedition in the first place, is dead. Philips is dead, and that leaves Anderson holding the scribblings of a murderous lunatic-- scribblings with today''s date circled in blood.');

She was born in mainland China, and on the next day, a group of monks arrived at her home, asking if any children had been born there the night before. The monks were seeking a child of prophecy, and although they were surprised to find that she was a girl, they wished to take and train her at their monastery. Her parents, both poor and devout, agreed, after making sure she would be well cared for.
The monks began her on a rigorous training program nearly as soon as she could walk, teaching her every martial arts technique they could, going so far as to invite instructors from other countries to teach her. She knew from a young age that she was fated to perform an incredibly dangerous task when the time came, so she pursued her studies with a will. Lily learned not only a myriad of deadly unarmed combat techniques, but also how to link her mind to her body on a fundamental level, each supporting the other.
Finally, last month, it happened. One of the monks awoke from his meditations screaming, "The Great Eye is opening! The final days are upon us!" before falling dead.
Now, Lily stands inside a magic shop in Arkham, hoping to find someone or something that will aid her in fulfilling her destiny.');

It had been the right move, checking herself into the sanitarium to recuperate after her last show. She still didn''t like to think about that play, of course-- all that strange chanting and those awful masks; they still appeared sometimes in her nightmares.
She glanced down again at the newspaper clipping in her hand. "Famous Director Hangs Himself!" She had decided to check out of the asylum when she had seen it and realized that there was something more to that play than just her own wild imaginings.
Subtly checking once more to make sure her derringer was still safely hidden, Lola strode back out onto center stage for what could be her final starring role.');

He climbed down the Seventy Steps of Light Slumber, faced the judgement of Nasht and Kamen-Tha, and walked through the Doors of Sleep into another world.
There, Luke had grand adventures, returning each night while he slept to explore the strange and wonderful land he''d discovered. In time, he began to start seeking the deeper mysteries of the places he went and the beings he talked to. He peeled back layers of secrecy until he came across a great truth--  the Dreamlands were real and he could physically travel there.
Luke wasted no time. He settled his affairs in the waking world and gathered up the mystic puzzle box his Uncle had left him. Then, he traveled to the gateway he''d learned of and passed through it, for what he thought was for good.
But word has come to him in the golden fields of the Dreamlands that a great evil is awakening, and the waking world is in danger. So, gathering up his possessions once more, Luke prepares to return to Arkham to help defeat this ancient evil. After all, although New England may seem dull and provincial after the splendors of the Dreamlands, it''s still home.');

Since then, she has worked with many of the University professors, delving into esoteric tomes filled with scientific information, historical reports, and sometimes even occult ramblings.
It was while reading an old book of prophecies last week that she first felt that she had stumbled onto something big. Mandy came to believe that certain signs and portents described in the book were taking place in Arkham right now-- omens that indicated the return of a terrible being reffered to as an Ancient One, which would grind the cities of Man beneath its loathsome tread.
Tonight, the full moon has turned blood red, which is the final omen of the return of the Ancient One. Slipping into the night, and armed with her knowledge of the prophecy, Mandy has decided to see if she can defy fate and stop these events from taking place.');

Marie''s grande-mere just passed away. Why the old dame moved from New Orleans to Arkham, Marie never knew. Anyway, she never paid much attention to the stories people told about the old woman.

Sophie believed him, she believed when he wrote her about the things he saw-- not the men killing other men, but the other things, the monsters. She believed, and that was enough to keep him sane in the trenches, enough to keep him alive.
Then he came home and went to visit Sophie, and he found out that the reason she believed him was that she had one of the creatures inside her, eating her from the inside out. As he watched in helpless horror, she faded away into the air, screaming as the thing finished its meal.
Now everyone thinks Mark Harrigan is crazy. Maybe he is. Maybe he''s finally lost it. But he knows the monsters are real and they''re here, and he''s got to stop them. As he crouches down in front of the alter in South Church, he prays for Sophie''s soul, and he prays for forgiveness for the many, many sins he''s about to commit all over this godforsaken town.');

They worked hard to get ahead, and Minh was able to attend a small community college. Although she was often teased or harrassed because of her heritage, Minh tried to focus on her studies, reminding herself that her parents had faced much worse in Korea. Eventually, she was able to finish her degree and landed a job at a small office in Arkham.
Initially Minh was mostly worried that her employer might make improper advances towards her, but Mr. Thomas seemed uninterested in her in that way, so she relaxed and concentrated on her work. Then he loaned her the book. As she started to read The King in Yellow, she found herself repulsed and horrified by its contents. When she expressed these feelings to Mr. Thomas, he just smiled oddly and told her, "Keep reading, it gets better towards the end." Although fearful for her job, she returned the book to him, saying it just wasn''t her sort of thing.
The next day, she received a call from the hospital. Mr. Thompson was dead - suicide - and for some reason she was listed as his emergency contact.
So, Minh now finds herself standing outside St. Mary''s Hospital with Mr. Thompson''s personal possessions, including that terrible book, wondering what to do.');

Monterey has been a globe-trotting treasure hunter and adventurer for many years. Following in his father''s footsteps, he''s always tried to ensure that the specific value of his finds is preserved. Recently, he followed a lead on an odd prehistoric statue to Arkham. However, when he arrived, the man he came to buy the statue from was locked up in the asylum. Monterey was just about to give up and go home in disgust when a robed figure pushed past him.
For just an instant, there was a flash of a silver pendant with a symbol on it Monterey would never forget. That symbol had been carved into his murdered father''s forehead, and had haunted his dreams for years.
Chasing after the mysterious figure, he turned a corner only to discover that he had lost his quarry.
However, Monterey knows that somewhere in Arkham may lie the answer to the mystery of his father''s murder, and he''s not leaving until he finds it.');

While Norman would never claim to be especially courageous, he''d be the first to admit that he has an inability to ignore a mystery.
So when six stars vanished from the section of sky he was studying, he couldn''t just let it go, not even when his colleagues told him that he was just imagining things and sent him home to sleep it off.
It took him years, not to mention the near death of his career, but he eventually found his answers in a book that none of his colleagues would be caught dead reading. An ancient tome, it described the stars and the sequence in which they would vanish, even detailing the date when their disappearance would take place. It was a sign, the book said, of the end of everything. It was the harbinger of a great beast that would tear asunder all that man had wrought.
Norman isn''t sure what he can do to stop the beast from destroying the world. He knows that he isn''t very strong, but if an answer can be found in the stars, then he will stand in the path of destruction until his dying breath.');

The soaring sonatas, the graceful arias, and the booming marches have always been her closest companions.
But sometimes as she plays, she can sense something at the edge of her awareness - something that watches her and waits, for what she doesn''t know.
The presence has been growing over the last month, and her increasing nervousness is starting to spoil her ability to play the violin. That''s not something she can tolerate.
So when an old gypsy she was swapping tunes with told her that she was being watched by an evil spirit, Patrice listened with somewhat less skepticism than she might have had even a month ago. The gypsy referred her to a shop in Arkham that might have what she needs to get rid of the spirit.
That explains why Patrice finds herself entering the Curiositie Shoppe this evening, feeling a little silly and more than slightly nervous.');

The rest of the trip hadn''t gone any better. The diary he''d found detailing the secret rituals of the local cults had gone missing, but Rex was used to things like that. Heck, he''d discovered and lost enough evidence of strange things over the years to almost believe he might be cursed. That business in Innsmouth with the photographs that had blown out to sea in the wind. The tracks in Dunwich that had washed away in the rain just before he''d brought the sheriff out to see.

Still, while running away might be the best way to avoid this premonition of personal doom hanging over her, that''s never been Rita''s style. Whether her stalkers are members of the Klu Klux Klan or something even more sinister, she''s going to face them head on, the same way she''s been facing the world all her life.');

If you looked in the Federal Agent''s handbook, you''d find a picture of Roland Banks next to those sections. At least, if it had any pictures, you would.
Where other agents found the rules restricting and annoying, Roland took comfort in procedure. It was a relief to have guidelines to follow in any given situation. Well, at least until this latest case.
Try as he might, Roland could find no mention in the handbook of what to do when confronted with strange creatures, gates through time and space, or magic spells. This case was rapidly escalating into a fiasco, and if he dropped the ball, losing his job was the least of his worries.
Sitting outside the Asylum after an interview with yet another demented witness, Roland dropped his battered Agent''s handbook back into his briefcase and sighed. At least the agency was sending him some backup. Maybe they could help him make some sense out of this mess.');

It came as no surprise to his family when Silas announced that he''d decided to become a sailor and travel the world. They''d actually been waiting for him to reach that conclusion for several years.
So, he signed up with a merchant shipping company and spent the next few years gallivanting from one port to the next and seeing all the sights he could take in.
Periodically, he would dream. At these times, his sleep was haunted with strange, ethereal visions of undersea vistas and bizarre creatures that smiled toothily at him. Gradually, he came to feel that there was something sinister about these dreams, and when he asked his family, they simply nodded and said, "It''s time for you to visit the main branch of the family up in Innsmouth. They''ll set you straight."
Two days later, as he disembarks from a ship at the Arkham docks, Silas can''t help but find his family''s remark just a little bit sinister.');

Now, after witnessing Father Michael''s strange mood swings and seeing some of the bizarre practices that go on in this town, she''s beginning to feel that she may have been a bit too hasty ...
For instance, last night, there was a knock on the door of the church, and when she answered it, there was nothing but a handwritten journal laying on the steps outside. Reading it, she learned of strange cults and terrible creatures that lurk in the darkness. Worse, when she laughingly showed it to Father Michael, he turned pale and threw it into the fire, yelling at her to forget what she''d seen.
Now, gathering her things and quietly leaving South Church, Sister Mary has decided to investigate this town, and in so doing, reaffirm her faith.');

When he told the cops that he''d needed the money for an operation for his mother, they''d just laughed. Apparently they''d heard that excuse once or twice before.
His mother died of her illness during the second year of his sentence. After that, no one came to visit him. He managed to cling to his sanity by befriending his cellmate, a scrawny little guy named Brad Hollins. Brad was a weird guy. He would rant and rave in a quiet voice every evening about the "Old Ones" and tell Skids about bizarre adventures he''d had while dreaming. Skids humored him until one night he''d woken up to hear Brad chanting strange words, still asleep. Smelling smoke, Skids turned to look at his cellmate just in time to see Brad scream and burst into flames. The screws had tried to pin it on him, but really, there was no way they could get it to stick.
Now, finally out on parole, Skids finds himself staying in a place that Brad frequently mentioned in his ravings - the city of Arkham. Perhaps he can find some answers to the questions raised by his friend''s death.');

He should''ve let it go when it dove into the river, but he''d never let a bounty escape before, and he hadn''t been about to start then. Drawing his knife, he''d gone in after it, and everything had become a blur of blood, shrieking horror, and muddy water.
Three days later, he''d awakened in the hospital, muttering to himself and shaking with a mixture of fear and anger over his escaped quarry.
After two weeks, the doctors have finally declared him fit enough to leave and get back to his hunt. But this time, his prey isn''t human, whatever it is.');

Somehow, she had come to the attention of a nameless agency working for the government to protect the country. Never one to turn down a new challenge, Trish had eagerly signed up.
One of the first things that they taught her is that there is strength in focus - in joining the mind to the body to exceed the whole. With her agile body and formidable mind, she was soon one of their best spies.
But recently, Trish has begun to wonder at the motives of the organization she works for. Are they really tied to the government, or is she working for some sort of shadow society ruling the country from behind the scenes? Her quiet inquiries eventually led her to the small city of Arkham, Massachusetts.
Normally, newspaper buildings are something that Trish avoids like the plague in her line of work. But standing in front of the Arkham Advertiser, she knows that this is her last lead. If the information she needs is anywhere, it''ll be here.');

Fewer still can say they''ve stolen a golden idol from a tribe of cannibals. Among women in a male-dominated society, Ursula is probably unique in being able to make these sorts of claims.
Ever since she was a small girl, Ursula had broken the rules set down for her: climbing trees, playing in the mud, exploring the woods, and plenty of other things "that a proper young lady shouldn''t have been doing."
After all, she was as good as any man. When she was accepted to Boston University, she set out to prove it, excelling and exceeding the other students in Archaeology. She graduated top of her class and used her inheritance to set herself up as an explorer, roaming all over the world and writing articles for magazines.
Now her path has brought her here to Arkham, following a shipment of stolen relics, a cult that seems to have members in very corner of the world, and a trail of corpses. Smiling to herself, Ursula thinks, "Now THIS is an adventure."');

Wendy went to the orphanage. Before they took her away, Mama gave her the necklace. "Keep this close, Wendy. It''ll protect you when I can''t. Always remember that your Mama loves you."
Wendy stayed in the orphanage for several years before running away, finally deciding that she could take better care of herself the state could.
Now, Wendy stands in front of the bank, staring at the photograph someone dropped into her cup when she wasn''t looking - a photograph of her father, with an even more mysterious message written on the back, "Soon the Red Tide rises. Stay safe, my little girl."
Looking up, Wendy feels something welling up inside her that she hasn''t felt for many years - hope.');

After studying for years to become a Shakespearean actor, he found that dramatic monologues didn''t put bread on the table. So, desperate for work, he had accepted a job as a gravedigger.
He figured that while gravedigging was an unusual job, there wasn''t really anything wrong with it. After all, one of Shakespeare''s best scenes involved a gravedigger. Sure, the work was hard and dirty, but William had never shied away from honest labor before.
That, of course, was before the weird corpses began turning up. Strange, inhuman things, they caused William''s flesh to crawl and his palms to sweat. He began to see strangers watching him wherever he went, and he knew instinctively that taking the corpses to the University would be the last mistake he ever made.
Which is why William find himself in the pews at South Church. While he has never been a particularly religious man, he finds that Father Michael usually has good advice. Today, William feels like that could make all the difference in the world.');

She''d known it ever since God had spoken to her one night when she was six years old... the night that terrible fire took away her parents. He told her that He had chosen her from among all the people of the world to be His agent. She would protect the innocent and punish the wicked.
Since then, He came to her in times of trouble, offering guidance and comfort. He has also come to lead her to an evildoer on several occasions. In each instance, with His aid, good triumphed. Then, one day, He spoke to her, telling her to come to Arkham, where she would face her greatest challenge yet. He has not spoken to her since.
Now, as Zoey steps off the train onto the platform, she fingers her cross, feeling the wrongness of this place in her bones. Perhaps if she cleanses the city of its taint, He will speak to her once again.');
